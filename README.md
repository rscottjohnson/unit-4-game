# Crystals Collector
### A selection game that dynamically updates HTML pages with the jQuery library

The Crystals Collector game demonstrates the use of the jQuery library to dynamically update HTML pages.

## Motivation
Events are included in Crystals Collector for capturing the user's image clicks and then executes through a sequence of logic steps to determine if the users score has exceeded the score to guess until which time the user either wins (guesses the score exactly) or overruns the score.

## Project Usefulness
This project incorporates jQuery learnings on how to correctly select and manipulate HTML elements within the DOM.

## Getting Started
Upon loading, Crystals Collector presents the user with a row of instructions and a row of four crystals to choose from in order to update their score.

1.  The user selects a crystal.
2.  Once they've chosen their crystal, their score will be updated and compared to the number to guess.
3.  This selection continues until the user's score either matches the number to guess (at which point the user wins) or the user's score goes over the number to guess (at which point the user loses).
